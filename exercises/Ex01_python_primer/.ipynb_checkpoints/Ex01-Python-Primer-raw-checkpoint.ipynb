When you press Enter while selecting a cell, you jump into editing mode and can change the content of a cell, e.g. by writing code.\n",

Text is written in markup cells, which allow nice formatting similar to LaTeX, while code should be written in code cells. There, the code can be run interactively and the output will be visualized in the notebook.\n",

    "Unlike R, Python is primarily a programming language, so its standard object classes behave a little different. When indexing lists and similar objects, always remember that python starts counting indices at 0. When slicing x[start:end], the end value is *not* included in the output. You can index from the end using the minus like x[0:-2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference is that many objects can be modified in-place, i.e. without reassignment common in R like x <- x[1:2]. This increases speed and memory efficiency, but be careful when running code multiple times or in a different order. Also be aware that objects are not copied when reassigned, but instead linked to the original content, which may change. If you'd like to copy a list, use a complete index [:].\n"
